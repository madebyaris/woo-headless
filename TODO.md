## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### **Priority 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors - BLOCKING DEVELOPMENT**
- **Total Errors:** 307 errors across 17 files
- **Root Cause:** `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` in tsconfig.json causing strict optional property checking
- **Impact:** Prevents compilation and development progress

**Error Breakdown:**
- Checkout Module: 171 errors (missing interface properties, type mismatches)
- Cart Module: 63 errors (readonly property assignments, optional type issues)
- Search Module: 33 errors (readonly assignments in builder pattern)
- User Module: 16 errors (optional property compatibility)
- Other Modules: 24 errors (unused imports, minor type issues)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Interface Updates:** Add missing properties to CheckoutSession, PaymentMethod, Order interfaces
2. **Builder Pattern Fix:** Create mutable internal state for SearchQueryBuilder
3. **Optional Type Compatibility:** Fix exactOptionalPropertyTypes compatibility across all interfaces
4. **Property Access Fixes:** Update property access patterns for strict mode
5. **Unused Code Cleanup:** Remove unused imports and variables

### **Priority 2: Integration Testing Validation**
- **Real API Testing:** ‚úÖ Successfully tested with real WooCommerce API at https://barengmember.applocal/
- **Cart/Checkout Flow:** ‚úÖ Successfully created real orders ($122 total) with customer attribution
- **Product Management:** ‚úÖ Successfully validated 23 products, 5+ categories
- **Missing:** Automated integration test suite for CI/CD

### **Priority 3: Framework Adapters - NOT STARTED**
- React Package (`@woo-headless/react`): ‚ùå Not implemented
- Vue Package (`@woo-headless/vue`): ‚ùå Not implemented  
- Svelte Package (`@woo-headless/svelte`): ‚ùå Not implemented

2. **Day 3-4:** Resolve SearchQueryBuilder readonly property assignments  
3. **Day 5:** Fix cart module exactOptionalPropertyTypes compatibility
4. **Day 6-7:** Clean up user module and remaining type issues

### Week 2: Testing & Framework Preparation
1. **Day 1-2:** Create automated integration test suite
2. **Day 3-4:** Set up React adapter package structure
3. **Day 5-7:** Begin React hooks implementation (useProducts, useCart, useCheckout)
